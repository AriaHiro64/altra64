hello here is my menu for the everdrive64.
if you don't have one you should visit krikzzs homepage
for ordering information. ^^

if you want to build the menu, you need a n64 toolchain
you can get one free from

http://www.dragonminded.com/n64dev/libdragon/
https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon

i used the libmikmod linked on his site too for the menu
http://www.dragonminded.com/n64dev/libmikmod-3.2.0-beta2.tgz


if you are on linux, try out the build script
https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/tree/master/tools/build

here are a few setting hints
export INSTALL_PATH=/usr/mips64-elf
set this to your home directory if you don't have root access

i was in need to alter the cxxflags to G0 to lowercase
CXXFLAGS="-g0 -O2"

it's a good idea to the latest versions for the toolchain
export BINUTILS_V=2.23.52
export GCC_V=4.8.0
export NEWLIB_V=1.20.0


optional:
get libn64-hkz to get more into flashram savegames
http://sourceforge.net/projects/n64dev/
